VibeMatch+ — “Smart chemistry for modern love.”
	•	The “+” makes it look like a tech app (like Health+).







Here’s a full visual identity + logo direction + color system tailored for your Flutter UI and viral app goals.

🎨 Brand Identity: “VibeMeter”

🌟 Core Concept

“Measure your connection. Share your vibe.”
A blend of fun, curiosity, and light science — playful enough for social media, clean enough for the App Store.

⸻

1. 🩷 Logo Design Concept

A. Symbol Mark
	•	Shape: A heart + dial fusion, symbolizing “love” and “measurement.”
	•	The heart is divided into four arcs, subtly representing the four compatibility metrics (Love, Communication, Trust, Overall).
	•	A needle or glow point sweeps across like a speedometer.

B. Style
	•	Flat-gradient vector style, friendly yet techy.
	•	Works in both solid and outlined versions (for dark/light modes).

C. Example Composition

❤️  +  📊  →  "VibeMeter" Icon

[heart outline] with a glowing arc filling clockwise,
below it the text “VibeMeter” in rounded sans-serif.

D. Font Suggestions

Use modern, round-edged fonts for friendliness and mobile readability:
	•	Primary Logo Font: Poppins SemiBold or Nunito Sans Bold
	•	Secondary UI Font: Inter or Montserrat

Example pairing:

Logo: “VibeMeter” in Poppins SemiBold
Tagline: “Test your connection” in Inter Medium (smaller, 70% opacity)

2. 🌈 Color Palette

Emotion	Color	Usage	Hex Code
Love / Warmth	Gradient Pink–Coral	Primary accent, buttons, progress arcs	#FF6F61 → #FF8FA3
Trust / Calm	Aqua Blue	Trust meter, background gradient	#4A90E2
Communication / Balance	Lavender Purple	Secondary highlights, text gradients	#6B5B95
Overall Neutral	Soft Off-White	Background for cards	#F9F7FB
Dark Mode Base	Deep Indigo	Background (dark mode)	#1C1B29

👉 Flutter Gradient Example:

LinearGradient(
  colors: [Color(0xFFFF6F61), Color(0xFF6B5B95)],
  begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  end: Alignment.bottomRight,
)

This keeps it romantic but techy, perfect for animated meters.

3. ⚙️ UI Integration

Splash Screen
	•	Logo animation: Heart-meter needle sweeps once → tagline fades in.
	•	Tagline: “Measure your connection. Share your vibe.”
	•	Background: Gradient #FF6F61 → #6B5B95 with soft particles or heart pulses.

Results Screen (from your Flutter layout)
	•	Use gradient arcs in your CircularPercentIndicator.
	•	Background: Subtle diagonal gradient from coral to lavender.
	•	Iconography: Soft glowing heart icons near each score meter.
	•	“Share Results” Button: Gradient fill with white text and a share icon → adds consistency with the logo.
